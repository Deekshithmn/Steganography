# Steganography
Image Steganography is a technique used to hide secret information within an image without visibly altering the image itself. In this project, the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method is used to embed text or data into the pixel values of an image. The system enables secure communication by concealing the existence of the message, making it difficult for third parties to detect or extract the hidden
information.
